# == Define Resource Type: haproxy::balancermember
#
# This type will setup a balancer member inside a listening service
#  configuration block in /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg on the load balancer.
#  currently it only has the ability to specify the instance name,
#  ip address, port, and whether or not it is a backup. More features
#  can be added as needed. The best way to implement this is to export
#  this resource for all haproxy balancer member servers, and then collect
#  them on the main haproxy load balancer.
#
# === Requirement/Dependencies:
#
# Currently requires the ripienaar/concat module on the Puppet Forge and
#  uses storeconfigs on the Puppet Master to export/collect resources
#  from all balancer members.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*name*]
#   The title of the resource is arbitrary and only utilized in the concat
#    fragment name.
#
# [*listening_service*]
#    The haproxy service's instance name (or, the title of the
#     haproxy::config resource). This must match up with a declared
#     haproxy::config resource.
#
# [*balancer_port*]
#     A unique port for which the balancer member will accept connections
#     from the load balancer. Note that cookie values aren't yet supported,
#     but shouldn't be difficult to add to the configuration.
#
# [*order*]
#     The order, or numerical weight, of the fragment created by this defined
#      resource type. This is necessary to ensure the fragment is associated
#      with the correct listening service instance.
#
# [*server_name*]
#     The name of the balancer member server as known to haproxy in the
#      listening service's configuration block. This defaults to the
#      hostname
#
# [*balancer_ip*]
#      The ip address used to contact the balancer member server
#
# [*balancermember_options*]
#      An array of options to be specified after the server declaration
#       in the listening service's configuration block.
#
#
# === Examples
#
#  Exporting the resource for a balancer member:
#
#  @@haproxy::balancermember { 'haproxy':
#    listening_service      => 'puppet00',
#    balancer_port          => '8140',
#    order                  => '21',
#    server_name            => $::hostname,
#    balancer_ip            => $::ipaddress,
#    balancermember_options => 'check',
#  }
#
#
#  Collecting the resource on a load balancer
#
#  Haproxy::Balancermember <<| listening_service == 'puppet00' |>>
